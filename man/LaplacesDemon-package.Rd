  The goal of LaplacesDemon, often referred to as Laplace's Demon, is to
  provide a complete and self-contained Bayesian environment within R.
  For example, this package includes dozens of MCMC algorithms, Laplace
  Approximation with multiple optimization algorithms, PMC, over 80
  examples in the ``Examples'' vignette, dozens of additional
  probability distributions, numerous MCMC diagnostics, Bayes factors,
  posterior predictive checks, a variety of plots, elicitation,
  parameter and variable importance, Bayesian forms of test statistics
  (such as Durbin-Watson, Jarque-Bera, etc.), validation, and numerous
  additional utility functions, such as functions for multimodality,
  matrices, or timing your model specification. Other vignettes include
  an introduction to Bayesian inference, as well as a tutorial.

  There are many plans for the growth of this package, and many are
  long-term plans such as to cotinuously stockpile distributions,
  examples, samplers, and optimization algorithms. Contributions to this
  package are welcome.

  The main function in this package is the \code{LaplacesDemon}
  function, and the best place to start is probably with the
  LaplacesDemon Tutorial vignette.
