\title{Centering and Scaling}
\description{
  This function either centers and scales a continuous variable and
  provides options for binary variables, or returns an untransformed
  variable from a centered and scaled variable.
}
\usage{
CenterScale(x, Binary="none", Inverse=FALSE, mu, sigma, Range, Min)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{This is a vector to be centered and scaled, or to be
    untransformed if \code{Inverse=TRUE}.}
  \item{Binary}{This argument indicates how binary variables will be
    treated, and defaults to \code{"none"}, which keeps the original
    scale, or transforms the variable to the 0-1 range, if not already
    there. With \code{"center"}, it will center the binary variable by
    subtracting the mean. With \code{"center0"}, it centers the binary
    variable at zero, recoding a 0 to -0.5, and a 1 to 0.5. Finally,
    \code{"centerscale"} will center and scale the binary variable,
    subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations.}
  \item{Inverse}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then a centered and scaled
    variable \code{x} will be transformed to its original, un-centered
    and un-scaled state. This defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
  \item{mu, sigma, Range, Min}{These arguments are required only when
    \code{Inverse=TRUE}, where \code{mu} is the mean, \code{sigma} is
    the standard deviation, \code{Range} is the range, and \code{Min} is
    the minimum of the original \code{x}. \code{Range} and \code{Min}
    are used only when \code{Binary="none"} or \code{Binary="center0"}.}
}
\details{
  Gelman (2008) recommends centering and scaling continuous predictors
  to facilitate MCMC convergence and enable comparisons between
  coefficients of centered and scaled continuous predictors with
  coefficients of untransformed binary predictors. A continuous
  predictor is centered and scaled as follows: \code{x.cs <- (x -
    mean(x)) / (2*sd(x))}. This is an improvement over the usual
  practice of standardizing predictors, which is \code{x.z <- (x -
    mean(x)) / sd(x)}, where coefficients cannot be validly compared
  between binary and continuous predictors.
}
\value{
  This function returns a centered and scaled vector, or the
  untransformed vector.
